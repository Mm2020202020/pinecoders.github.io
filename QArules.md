Welcome to "PineCoders Pine Scriptâ„¢ Q&A", the only TradingView-supported group on Telegram where programmers of all levels help each other resolve programming challenges in Pine Scriptâ„¢.


ðŸ”¸ RULES

These are our rules. There are few, but the PineCoders who manage this room have a mandate to enforce them strictly. Violators risk instant and permanent bans:

1. Be civil and respectful.

2. Allowed content consists of:
â€¢ Specific questions on coding
â€¢ Answers to those questions

3. Make it easy for those you are asking for help.
BEFORE posting questions:
â€¢ Research, try on your own and troubleshoot. If you don't know how to debug in Pine Scriptâ„¢, use the tips in the User Manual's page on Debugging (https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/writing/Debugging.html).
â€¢ RTFM: Reference Manual (https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v5/), User Manual (https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/en/v5/Introduction.html).
â€¢ Look for your question in the PineCoders FAQ (https://www.pinecoders.com/faq_and_code/).
WHEN YOU POST:
â€¢ Gather your thoughts and write a well-formed statement of the issue and your question in a single post. Do NOT multi-post.
â€¢ If it is pertinent, show a complete, compilable code snippet that demonstrates what you have tried, or that reproduces the unexpected behavior you are asking about.
â€¢ Use monospace formatting (single backticks for inline, triple backticks for code blocks, or select, right-click and use the popup menu). If the code is long, use pastebin (https://pastebin.com/), 0bin (https://0bin.net/), controlc (https://controlc.com/), etc.
â€¢ When it can be useful, share a link to a chart snapshot (ALT/CMD-S on a chart).

5. Do not shill, do not advertise, do not discuss trading or trading models/strategies. Do not ask for programmers to write a script for you; contact one of our Trusted Pine Scriptâ„¢ Programmers For Hire (https://www.tradingview.com/u/?solution=43000601677) instead.
